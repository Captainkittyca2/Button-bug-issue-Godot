# Button-bug-issue-Godot
First open Root.tscn, it should have Root.gd as script for the Root node but if it doesn't then put Root.gd as script for root node. Then run the game, if the screen doesn't appear properly when booting up the game, press windows+left or windows+right arrow key. click anywhere on the screen, you should now notice 2 button nodes appearing, one on the left is for TextureRect2 and the other on the right is for TextureRect3. if you expand the screen size horizontally enough, you should notice that the left button suddenly doesn't respond to the mouse, however the right button still does, and if you minimize the screen horizontally enough, the left one will work again. I'm not entirely sure why this happens and I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can help me find out why it's like this.
